# Examine: Performance varying with N and theta

In this testcase, we can examine the performance of treeeeee, comparing the speed of tree algorithm and brute force computation.

# How to use:
1. Run `sh run_all.sh` in the terminal in "n" or "theta" folder.
2. Wait for the plot generated automatically.
3. When you no longer need the data, run `sh clean.sh` to clean up all the data.

# Composition of this testcase:
```
generate.py     : set up the test initial condition
plot.py         : plot the performance curve
parse_time.py   : read the log generated by treeeeee
run_all.sh      : the script written for the whole examine process
clean.sh        : the script cleans up all the data and figure.
```

# Parameter to be tuned:
No parameter to be tuned in this testcase.
