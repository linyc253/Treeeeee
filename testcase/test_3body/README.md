# Demo: 3-Body Problem

In this testcase, we simulate 3-body problem. We hope to see the computational stability of different parameters perspectively through this simple testcase.

# How to use:
1. Run `sh run_all.sh` in the terminal in this folder.
2. Wait for the plot generated automatically.
3. When you no longer need the data, run `sh clean.sh` to clean up all the data.

# Composition of this testcase:
```
Energy.py   : plot the energy curve
plot.py     : generate animation
run_all.sh  : the script written for the whole process to do
clean.sh    : the script cleans up all the data, figure, animation generated.
```

# Parameter to be tuned:
No parameter to be tuned in this testcase.
